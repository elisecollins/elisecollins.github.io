<br>
Our founder, Wilbur Tekton, started as an iron worker in a construction factory in the late 1800s. His spirit of perseverance, which permeates the company today, led him to work his way up the ladder (literally and physically). He became manager of his factory and eventually purchased it. After buying more factories, he formed Tekton Construction in 1892. It has expanded over time to become the leading business-related commercial construction company in the United States! Tekton's iconic quote, written above, remains our company motto to this day - a testament to our commitment not only to growth but to remembering our roots.
