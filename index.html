<h1>Our Mission</h1>
<p>
At Tekton, our mission is to provide stable, high quality construction services to customers around the United States. We specialize in commercial projects, building mostly offices for high-performing businesses like you!
</p>
<h1>Our History</h1>
<p>
Our founder, Joseph Tekton, created Tekton to replace the gaping hole in his heart left by his wife's divorce (she left him for a better man).
